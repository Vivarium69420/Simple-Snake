## What is Simple Snake
The game is written with pygame library.
This game of snake though seem simple enough with all the basic control you see in a normal snake game.
But in this version, will have a lot more features that may excite players.
- Power-ups (coming-soon)
    - The ability to snip apple from a distance.
    - Having full control of the snake head, without it running on autopilot.
    - Able to eat his own body.
    - etc.
- Challenges (coming-soon)
    - Increase snake speed. (Cherry)
    - Reverse control. (Banana)
    - Flash-bang. (Fig)
    - etc.
- Secret endings (coming-soon)

## Current problems
- I'm having difficulty with setting up the sound with pygame. At the beginning and end of the audio, there is this weird static noise.
- When trying to spawn other fruits using USEREVENTS during the run of the game. When the event terminate, and reset, so does the fruit. I haven't figure out how to allow the fruits to stay drawn on screen.
